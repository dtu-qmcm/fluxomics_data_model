"""Base protocols for fluxomics format parsers and writers.

All format-specific parsers and writers in this package are expected to
conform to :class:`FluxomicsParser` and :class:`FluxomicsWriter`.  Using
``Protocol`` rather than an abstract base class means existing classes do
not need to inherit from anything — they satisfy the protocol as long as
their method signatures match.

Adding a new format
-------------------
1. Create ``<format>_parser.py`` with a class whose ``parse`` method
   matches :meth:`FluxomicsParser.parse`.
2. Create ``<format>_writer.py`` with a class whose ``write`` method
   matches :meth:`FluxomicsWriter.write`.
3. Register the file-extension mapping in
   :func:`fluxomics_data_converter.io.parse`.
4. Export the new class and convenience function from ``io/__init__.py``.

    Notes on the ``experiment_name`` parameter
    ------------------------------------------
    Some formats (MTF, Freeflux) write a single experiment per file set and
    therefore require the caller to nominate which experiment to use when
    the model contains more than one.  The FluxML format writes all
    experiments in one file and ignores this parameter.  Writers that do not
    need it should accept (and silently ignore) ``experiment_name=None``.
